	<h1>About Us</h1>
	<p>
	  The Socialer started with a grand vision to enhance our lives, and the lives of others. We first came across the problem after we graduated college and moved to new cities. It was extremely difficult for us to become quickly immersed in the local culture, whether that was meeting interesting people or finding cool things to do. Our vision hangs on the idea that there are so many awesome experiences to be had in your city, they just need to be more easily accessible. Our goal for the site is that it becomes a place for you to discover new experiences, and to share those experiences with other interesting and awesome people. It is a work in progress, but our belief is that one day we will create a remarkable platform that will bring a lot of value to others.
